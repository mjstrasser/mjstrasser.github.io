title: About

I am Michael Strasser and this blog is the place where I capture
some fragments of knowledge about things.

I am a software developer at [ThoughtWorks](https://thoughtworks.com/)
in Brisbane, Australia. In my other lives I am an experienced singer
of ‘classical’ music, currently in choirs, a husband, father, irregular
commuter cyclist and occasional golfer.
